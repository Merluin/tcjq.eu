# Thomas Quettier – Personal Academic Website

This is the source code for my personal academic website, hosted at [https://tcjq.eu](https://tcjq.eu) and built using Jekyll, with a minimal and accessible layout inspired by the [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages) template.

## About

I am a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience. My work focuses on the neural and sensorimotor mechanisms of emotional expression, perception, and authenticity discrimination, with particular attention to facial motor control. This site includes information about my research, publications, teaching, and contact details.

## Structure

- `/assets/` — Images, CSS, and other static files  
- `_pages/` — Markdown source for pages (About, CV, etc.)  
- `_posts/` — Optional blog posts or news updates  
- `_data/` — YAML files for menus and structured content  
- `_config.yml` — Site configuration and metadata  
- `index.md` — Homepage content  

## Hosting

The site is statically generated with Jekyll and deployed via GitHub Pages. It is optimized for low energy consumption and sustainable web performance.
