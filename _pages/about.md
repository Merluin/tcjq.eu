## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience, currently based in Italy. My work focuses on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying emotional expression, perception, and authenticity discrimination. I am particularly interested in the motor control of facial expressions and the role of cutaneous mechanoreception in emotion recognition.

My research combines methods from cognitive neuroscience, psychophysics, and non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS).

I hold degrees in both psychology and philosophy, and my interdisciplinary background informs a broader interest in embodiment, affective communication, and the integration of sensorimotor and mentalizing processes.

My current projects include the development of a trigeminofacial force-balance model of facial expression control and the use of open-source tools to track emotional feedback in naturalistic interactions.
